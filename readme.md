#General Pasta

A collection of general functions that I have found myself copy pastaing around.

I am trying to separate the pasta into useful strands.

##log()

Takes any number of args and logs them if it can.

##arrify(obj)

Take an array like object and return a real array.

##combine(obj1, obj2)

Add everything from obj2 into obj1 and return obj1.

##last(item)

Attempt to return the last element from item, whatever
item might be.

##flatten(arr)

Steamrolls nested arrays into a string.
